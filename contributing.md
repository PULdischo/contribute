        create the workshop under your personal account or dischoPUL
        if from personal, fork the repository.
        specify the "owner" of the forked repo to be PUL_discho.

1.3. updating an existing workshop

    workshops should be updated every semester, ideally when the workshop is being run.
    workshops not being run that semseter should be updated once an academic year.
    you may make changes to the repository on github, by editing the files in the repository directly on github, or you may download ("clone") the repository, make changes on the downloaded files, and upload ("push") the changes to the "remote" repo on github. The latter option requires some knowledge about git (the underlying software for github), specifically how to initialize a repository, stage, commit, and push changes from your local machine to a remote repository.
